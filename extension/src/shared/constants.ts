   * - After this, switch to STEADY mode with debouncing for efficiency
   * - Too short: may miss initial large DOM loads

   * Debounce delay for MutationObserver callback invocations (ms).

   * Rationale:
   * - 75ms provides good balance between responsiveness and efficiency
   * - At 60fps, one frame = ~16.67ms, so 75ms = ~4.5 frames
   * - Typical user typing/scrolling generates 10-50 mutations per second

   * - We use requestIdleCallback which yields to more urgent work
   * - Actual execution may be shorter if browser needs the time
